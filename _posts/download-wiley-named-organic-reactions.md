The very similar book, **Reactions, Rearrangements and Reagents by S.N. Sanyal** is great book than Wiley's one. I personally have S.N. Sanyal's book and it is super good. This book is recommended by my teacher to me who also taught **All India 2018 JEE mains topper**. But PDF for this book is currently unavailable online, and i can't photo copy the book by my self as the publisher company is super strict on photo-coping to soft copies. So i strongly recommend to purchase the book from amazon link below.
