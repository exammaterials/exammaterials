Problems in General Physics containing about 1900 problems with hints for solving the most complicated ones has been designed for students studying advanced course in Physics. The book has been divided into six parts covering Physical Fundamentals of Mechanics, Thermodynamics & Molecular Physics, Electrodynamics, Oscillations & Waves, Optics and Atomic & Nuclear Physics, each segregated into number of chapters. Each chapter in the book opens with a time-saving summary of the principal formulas for the relevant area of physics. As a rule the formulas are given without detailed explanation. Explanatory notes are given in those cases where misunderstandings may arise. The author has used all formulas in the SI system, except in Part six where the Gaussian system has been used. Also the main physical constants and tables are summarized at the end of the book along with the Periodic System of Elements and Table of Elementary Particles also covered in the book. At the beginning of each chapter summary of principal formulas has been given for clarifying relevant basic concepts. At the end of each chapter, unsolved practice exercises have been provided to help aspirants revise the concepts discussed in the chapter. Answers and Solutions to the practice exercises have been given at the end after Part six. After the answers & solutions, appendices have also been provided for better comprehension of the concepts discussed in the book.
