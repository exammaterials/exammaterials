(or) Buy the original hard copy **2020 version** of these books from Amazon to support the author and for easy preparation. Due to the copyright strikings I cannot provide you the PDFs for latest updated versions since it is illegal. So I strongly recommend buying the **DC Pandey Arihant** set, This is my recommendation since each and every book in this series is worth it for jee advanced preparation. You will never regret if you purchase one since physics drags you in its love !!
