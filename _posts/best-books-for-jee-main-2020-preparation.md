Here you can check out the list of best books for jee main preparation in 2020. There are a lot of books these days in the market for JEE Main preparation which is focused on process-intensive problems which are simply exhausting for students. So below is a good list of books to purchase for JEE Mains preparation which is best to learn and practice from.

Since each book has its pros and cons I will mention those in the review. So let's get started.

## Best books for JEE Main preparation - Physics

### 1) Concepts of physics by HC Verma

Concepts of physics by HC Verma is a great book. If you can afford only a few books for your preparation this book is must to be in your list. This book, Besides covering the entire syllabus, it has a **huge pile of problems** that are must be practised by every IIT aspire. Whichever blog you search, whoever you ask, everyone first recommends this book.

Hence this book took place in almost every IITian and NIT student. It's no surprise that the **famous monkey problem** from this book brought HC Verma sir Padma Shri award.

At first, Some students think that the book doesn't expose to ‘better’ quality problems and considered it to be a waste of time. But to understand the process of solving a problem. Broadly,

1. You need to be **thorough with all the tools** (formulae, framework etc.) to solve the problem.
2. You must know **where, when and how to use these tools**.

HC Verma's Concepts of physics does exactly this, and it does it damn well!. Most of the other Physics books focus on problem-based learning. i.e. you learn a new thing from each problem, making it seem ‘challenging’. On the other hand, HCV teaches the *concepts of Physics* (Note the title of the book :) ) which is most crucial in solving problems.

Also, this book gives you the confidence in tackling problems by making you perfect in formulas and framework and a good amount of examples to make you strong in physics. Hence this is one of the best books for jee main. This book makes a student accept the challenge of solving problems with ground-based concepts. If you want to you can go through the book by [downloading PDF](https://exammaterials.in/?s=hc+verma) from our website before purchasing online. Hence making **_HV Verma's Concept of physics by no means overrated_**

### 2) Handbook of physics by Arihant

No preparation is done without being thorough with formulas. Formulas play a very vital role in JEE Main. Though you have a great hold on the subject, you can't derive a formula in middle on the exam as you have only 180 minutes for 90 bits.

Thus this book comes to rescue. This book is written by experts at Arihant Publication which holds all formulas which are most frequently being used in most of the problems. As it's known that Arihanth books the best readable font and text formats, Its easy for you to memorize and spend a good quality of time with. Also, this book is very cheap around (₹100 to ₹150).

I strongly recommend you to purchase this book and spend at least 20 minutes of your 1,440 minutes every day.

### 3) Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick & Walker (Amit Gupta Version)

Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick & Walker has been a fundamental guide for all physics veterans on this globe for decades. By this, you can understand the hype around this book. This book is filled with **A-class theory** for JEE Main especially in _Amit Gupta Version_. Hence this is one of the best books for jee main for physics theories.

HC Verma's Concepts of Physics and Fundamentals of Physics by Halliday, Resnick & Walker (Amit Gupta Version) is a **deadly combination** for JEE Main preparation. Learning concepts from this book and practising problems from HCV gives you a clear upper hand on your competitors.

### 4) Understanding Physics by DC Pandey

Again, This book is from Arihant publications. Hence it is made friendly for readers to read and easy to understand. DC Pandey, the author of this book is also one of the most respected figures in the JEE world. I Recommend this book for its detailed derivation and for around 100 solved problems at the end of every chapter. The theory in this book is very well explained is basic easy to understand language.

This book is clearly an allrounder hence deserving its place in this best books for jee main preparation list. I recommend you to purchase [optics and modern physics](https://amzn.to/2SYQtMy) since it has the **best in class derivations and solved examples** where no book has, **I Bet!**

### 2) Physical Chemistry for JEE Main and Advanced 2020 (By Arihant Experts)

Though NCERT is must to read chemistry for concepts, Physical Chemistry requires you to practice and learn new methods to attack the problem in a short amount of time. It also comes bundled free with **_20 video lectures_** on the various topic to make boring long study hours with some multimedia learning. Also, there are various set of solved problems which are sorted by the difficulty level. This book gets _**revised every year**_ by many experts in Arihant's arsenal.

> For inorganic Chemistry

Guys, to be frank, NCERT is Enough for inorganic chemistry and for problems you can search in my website for where you will get for free from various most famous JEE coaching centres and institutions. So I don't recommend any book for inorganic chemistry.

But if you want to own one I suggest [Balaji Problems in Inorganic Chemistry](https://amzn.to/3ajUsZB). Which is more than enough for JEE Mains

> Other books for entire chemistry

### 4) Handbook of Chemistry by Arihant

Now comes the **_real hero_** after NCERT. This book is really **epic** and is one of the best books for jee main. I scored **75 in Chemistry** in my JEE Main attempt event though **I am not that great in chemistry before**. And the only books I have was _NCERT and this Handbook_. This small book covers **all of JEE Mains syllabu**s for Organic and inorganic chemistry.

_You will be ready for JEE Main chemistry if you are alone with this only book_. I memorised this book 4 times at time exactly 5 days before the exam. And I got **all** of the inorganic chemistry questions correct and **missed only a few** organic chemistry problems.

(as far as physical chemistry is concerned I am weak in that and I got only one question correct from physical chemistry from that exam :( ).

Hence I strongly **recommend** this book to you. If you did not realise the value of this book now, you will at last few of your exam.

### 2) Handbook of Mathematics by Arihant

This book has all the important concepts for JEE Mains. Since most of the people do not care about theory in maths, Handbook of Mathematics provides not only formulas but important theory to remember as well.

Since Maths is something that can be mastered only by practising, I suggested only three books to follow, They are THM maths, Maths Handbook and Maths previous papers. These are enough for your JEE Mains preparation. So try to complete THM book (if you purchase) along with your coaching material. If you are self-studying you are always welcomed to download Various coaching institutions material for free from our [website](https://exammaterials.in/).
