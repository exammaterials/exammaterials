These are solely made by Joyoshish Saha. The notes helped many a lot during the last-minute preparation before exams and I think these would be helpful to you too to mug up the concepts and formulae fast.

These are not elaborated notes, and only the most important notes are taken for individual chapters. You can use these notes to revise the topics thoroughly. For more info you can visit https://plustwopcm.blogspot.com
