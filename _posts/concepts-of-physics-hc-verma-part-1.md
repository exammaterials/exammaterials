Here you can download HC Verma physics part 2. Concepts of physics HC Verma is the best book which includes the entire topics of physics with detail elucidation. This is an exhaustive book for **IIT JEE, AIEEE**. This book is a masterpiece for IIT JEE and AIEEE aspirants who have completed 10+2 standard or appearing in it. The concepts are given in a succinct and in a format to make it very easy to hold.

Many new books claimed that they have better than stuff than concepts of physics. but fails to match **HC Varma** level in terms of quality and variety of questions. There have been instances when questions are asked directly from the book Concept of physics.   
Physics is an immeasurable Subject and It is a difficult task to bound entire physics in 2 books with proper explanation of each and every topic. But HC Verma did his duty in Perfect way.

The best thing about the HC Verma book is that the concepts are portrayed in such a way that an average student can also perceive basic ideas in a straightforward way and can be able to solve large varieties of problems.

These books comes in two volumes. First volume covers[mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics), [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave) and [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics), and the second volume covers [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics), [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism), [modern physics .](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics)
