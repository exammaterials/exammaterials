Here you can download HC Verma solutions. Concepts of physics HC Varma is the best book which includes the entire topics of physics with detail elucidation. This is an exhaustive book for **IIT JEE, AIEEE**. This book admired by lot of students.

Because this book is a masterpiece for IIT JEE and AIEEE aspirants who have completed 10+2 standard or appearing in it. The concepts are given in a succinct and in a format to make it very easy to hold.

Also the best thing about the HC Verma book is that the concepts are portrayed in such a way that an average student can also perceive basic ideas in a straightforward way and can be able to solve large varieties of problems.

So these books comes in two volumes. First volume covers [mechanics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mechanics), [waves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wave) and [optics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Optics), and the second volume covers [thermodynamics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermodynamics), [electromagnetism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electromagnetism), [modern physics .](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modern_physics)
