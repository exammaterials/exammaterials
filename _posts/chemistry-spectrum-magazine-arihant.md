Chemistry spectrum by arihant is a magazine series which is published monthly every year with updated content and question for students to solve. It is a paid subscription for 12 months where subscribers get magazine every month via post.

Since the content is updated every year these magazines get very much great quality content. Each and every question has a reason for their existence in the book. These magazines contains various types of questions that Improves one's thought process.

Unlike books, these magazines are fun to solve and learn concepts from as the content is given interactive manner.

These magazines are divided into two, one for first year and other for second year. Each half contains one mind map, where both are mostly found in middle of magazine.

I recommend to solve these magazines If you find any free time or wanted break from regular boring Textbooks as these magazines are definitely fun to go through.
